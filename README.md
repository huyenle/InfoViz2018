# Code has been cleaned up a bit:
* All the data files go to data folder and renamed in js file already
* old files are deleted

# Disscusion with Devanshu:
* the idea of the visualization is going to be SCIENCE VS. RELIGION
* we're going to have a column on the left of the map for SCIENCE and a column on the right of the map for RELIGION. In both columns we have visualizations for that specific topic. 
* the first page need to fit to ONE PAGE only so that we don't have to scroll down
* the story to be told can base on continents
* maybe a second page for visualization with both religion and science to compare them/ have them together in a graph, or a 'show together' button, when you click it a combined chart will show

# Todo:
* By 20th March evening:
	* We all look together into how to arrange the map as in Chartlayout file
	* Fix the bubble chart (by today evening)
	* Connect Map - stacked - bubble -sunburst : Huyen
	* Have a header, 2 lines of description
	* for the presentation: have very specific ideas: why this topic, why the visualization, have a good story and have some use cases
	
	* Map:
		* small tooltip display pp's names/info
		* colors, legend
	* Stacked: colors according to continents: Huyen
	
	* RECONCILE the name of countries based on Patheon country name
	
* Button to sellect continent (if we have time)

* the report is due 2nd april, so don't focus on that for now
