# Final files are in "final_infovis" folder

# Remaining issues:
* The height of the charts are larger than the heigh of the page so we still need to scroll down --> Reduce it **to check on other laptops**
* Reconcile names in **data/** so that every country is shown - **done**
* Link the map --> bubble (the other way around is not necessary for now) **done**
* 2 Summarizing sentences --> **Let's meet tmr at 5:00** to discuss
* 4 tickboxes of the continents should be **checked** after loading the page
* Reconcile the colors (not necessarily exactly the same but look the same at least) **done**
* the report is due 2nd april, so don't focus on that for now
