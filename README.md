# Code has been cleaned up a bit:
* All the data files go to data folder and renamed in js file already
* old files are deleted

# Disscusion with Devanshu:
* the idea of the visualization is going to be SCIENCE VS. RELIGION
* we're going to have a column on the left of the map for SCIENCE and a column on the right of the map for RELIGION. In both columns we have visualizations for that specific topic. 
* the first page need to fit to ONE PAGE only so that we don't have to scroll down
* the story to be told can base on continents
* maybe a second page for visualization with both religion and science to compare them/ have them together in a graph, or a 'show together' button, when you click it a combined chart will show

# Todo:
* Arrange the map in a good html homepage:
	* An overview without science and religion???
	* have a header, 2 lines of description
	* for the presentation: have very specific ideas: why this topic, why the visualization, have a good story and have some use cases
* Map:
	* small tooltip display pp's names/info
	* colors, legend

* Sunburst:

* Stacked
	* colors according to continents
	
* Bubble
	* it does not display correctly now
	* Fix the axis

* Button to sellect continent (if we have time)

* RECONCILE the name of countries based on Patheon country name

* Connections need to do:
	* Sunburst - stacked area and bubble chart
	* Dropdown menu for countries (if we have time)

* the report is due 2nd april, so don't focus on that for now
