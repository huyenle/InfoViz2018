# Code has been cleaned up a bit:
* All the data files go to data folder and renamed in js file already
* old files are deleted

# Disscusion with Devanshu:
* the idea of the visualization is going to be SCIENCE VS. RELIGION
* we're going to have a column on the left of the map for SCIENCE and a column on the right of the map for RELIGION. In both columns we have visualizations for that specific topic. 
* the first page need to fit to ONE PAGE only so that we don't have to scroll down
* the story to be told can base on continents
* maybe a second page for visualization with both religion and science to compare them/ have them together in a graph, or a 'show together' button, when you click it a combined chart will show

# Todo:
* RECONCILE the name of countries based on Patheon country name

* we need to connect all visualizations together, in term of:
	* clicking/mouse over effect across the charts and map
	* color scales: one color for Asia, Europe, etc. instead of messy colors as right now.
 
* first show all visualizations on the level of continent. If you zoom in on the map into a continent, the content of all visualizations changes to the level of the countries in that continent the countries on on continent, then on country if clicked on continent. This could be applied for:
	* stacked area chart
	* bubble chart

* sunburst needs to be bigger, with clearer title/tooltips

* good html homepage: 
 	* have a header, 2 lines of description
	* click on it to show dashboard (?)

* for the presentation: have very specific ideas: why this topic, why the visualization, have a good story and have some use cases

* the report is due 2nd april, so don't focus on that for now
